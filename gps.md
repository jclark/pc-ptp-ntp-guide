# GPS receivers

My top recommendation is the BG7TBL TS-1: this provides a high-quality timing receiver, in a form that is convenient to
use with a PC, at an inexpensive price.

## BG7TBL TS-1

This became available in 2023. Internally, it uses the u-blox LEA-M8T module. This is a single band module.

I got mine on [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005753445408.html) for $77. It's also available on eBay.

Many GPS receivers being sold from China are fakes. But I am confident the one I got is not. The idea behind this product is
to repurpose timing modules originally manufactured for Huawei cellular base stations. These timing modules
are [available on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/333619130232) for about $50 or less, but they require some hard-to-find parts to wire up properly.

## ArduSimple simpleRTK2B M.2 ZED-F9P

The [simpleRTK2B M.2](https://www.ardusimple.com/product/simplertk2b-m-2/) fits into a M.2 E-key slot, which is the kind of slot PCs have for wifi cards.

The module is a u-blox ZED-F9P. It's designed for precise positioning (RTK), but it also supports time mode.
This is a dual band (L1/L2) module. It's a step up in both price and performance from the LEA-M8T used in the TS-1.

Note that this needs a dual band antenna for best performance.
