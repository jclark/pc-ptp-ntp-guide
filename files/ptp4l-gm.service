# The quoting here is rather intricate: the string gets interpreted first by systemd and then by bash.
# The single-quoted string following -c will be passed as an single argument to /bin/bash.
# Systemd interpretation will transform the argument by: (1) removing the single quotes
# (2) replacing %% by % (3) removing \ newline sequences (4) replacing \\ by \.
# The initial colon stops systemd transforming the $ characters
# (environment variable substitution is performed by bash not systemd).
# The date command figures out the TAI-UTC offset from the system's time zone database,
# which includes leap second information.
